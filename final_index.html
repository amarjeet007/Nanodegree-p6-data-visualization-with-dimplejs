   <h1>Titanic dataset Exploration</h1>
   
   <div>
   <p>
   On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. 
   One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class. 
   The dataset is explored for such patterns and the visualizations are plotted on demonstrate the findings.
